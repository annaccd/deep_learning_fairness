# What is the gender of a data scientist? Addressing bias in Natural Language Processing.

Repo for the Deep Learning tutorial. The course was thaught by Prof. Lynn Kaack and Florian Nachtigall during the winter semester 2022. It is part of the curriculum of the Master's of Data Science for Public Policy at the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/mds) in Berlin.

### 2. Description of the topic: 

Large NLP models are often trained by scraping large quantities of internet data, which might be unbalanced and reflect biases against specific populations, including stereotypical associations and negative sentiments (see, Bender, 2021). Itâ€™s not surprising that the models reproduce these biases in language generating and translation tasks. Female/male gender stereotypes were found in various pre-trained word embeddings, even the commonly used word2vec trained on Google News articles. In our tutorial, we show how bias can be identified through a translation task. Then we test how a Double-Hard Debias algorithm works compared to using non-debiased word embeddings. Lastly, we set up a translation task from scratch. 

### 3. The Notebook 
The notebook containing the tutorial is called **tutorial_fairness.ipynb** . It contains the following sections:

1. Memo
2. Overview
3. Background & Prerequisites
4. Software Requirements
5. Data Description
6. Methodology & Results
7. Limitations & Next Steps
8. References


### 4.  Relevance of the topic

Algorithms and models are used to substitute humans in several processes, including decision-making ones. In many cases they are implemented especially because they are believed to reduce human biases. However, we have now learnt how algorithms and models can learn, reproduce and even reinforce biases, depending on their use. With this tutorial, we want to show a solution to tackle one part of the problem, namely biased word embeddings. 

### 5. Further resources 
Further resources such as videos and readings to gain familiarity with the topic can be found in part 3 of the notebook. All references are listed in section 8. We are thankful for all the work which has been done on the topic and we had the opportunity to learn from. We hope the tutorial will be useful and clear.
